# RISC-V_workshop

ðŸš€ **RISC-V MYTH Workshop Summary**  
This repository documents my learnings and progress from the **"RISC-V based MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours)"** workshop conducted by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/riscv-based-myth/). The 30-hour hands-on workshop provides a beginner-friendly introduction to:

### ðŸ”¹ RISC-V Architecture
Understanding instruction formats, registers, memory access, and basic assembly programming using the open-source RISC-V ISA.

### ðŸ”¹ TL-Verilog
Learning Transaction-Level Verilog to describe digital hardware with higher abstraction and productivity.

### ðŸ”¹ Processor Design
Step-by-step development of a RISC-V-based 5-stage pipelined processor core.

### ðŸ”¹ Pipelining Concepts
Implementing and simulating instruction flow through stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-back) and resolving pipeline hazards.

---

Throughout this repository, you will find notes, code, diagrams, and implementation details related to RISC-V, TL-Verilog, and processor pipelining techniques, as explored during the workshop.
