# RISC-V_workshop

🚀 **RISC-V MYTH Workshop Summary**  
This repository documents my learnings and progress from the **"RISC-V based MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours)"** workshop conducted by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/riscv-based-myth/).

The 30-hour hands-on workshop provides a beginner-friendly introduction to:

- **RISC-V Architecture:** Instruction formats, registers, memory access, and assembly programming using the open-source RISC-V ISA.
- **TL-Verilog:** High-level hardware design using transaction-level modeling.
- **Processor Design:** Building a 5-stage pipelined processor based on RISC-V ISA.
- **Pipelining Concepts:** Implementing and simulating instruction flow and resolving hazards.
